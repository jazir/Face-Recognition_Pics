# Face-Recognition_Pics
DL Project to detect and recognize faces in pics

Initialization:
1) Store 2-3 pictures of the persons whom we want to identify in a named folder inside 'known_faces' folder.
ie, if we want to detect face of Obama, create a folder named 'obama' inside the 'known_faces' folder and keep 2-3 photos of him inside that folder. In the similar way, we can inculde any number of persons. Their pics need to be inisde a folder with their name.

2) Add pictures of the persons whom we want to detect with some random people inside the 'unknown_faces' folder.
